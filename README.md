#### The Repository Consists:<br>
The repository consists of two folders - api and client.
<ul><li>api contains all services that take care of the communication between the React application (frontend) and an API (backend). A single service provides multiple functions to retrieve data from or post data to an external service using the HTTP protocol.

<li>client it's our react app folder i.e. containing components, tests, css files etc.
</ul>

#### Aim/Objective of your project:<br>
The primary objective of online hotel reservation systems is to provide customers with a convenient and efficient way to book their accommodations. This includes providing an easy-to-use interface, secure payment processing, and access to up-to-date information about available rooms. Additionally, these systems should be able to quickly process reservations so that customers can get the room they need in a timely manner. Customers have access to detailed information about each property before making their booking decision and can easily complete the transaction without any issues or delays. It seeks to improve efficiency and operational process performance, strategies are established so that a hotel can be differentiated from what its competitors offer, better ways are sought to improve user experience and customer satisfaction. Also, it enables the hotel management to carry out their operations efficiently reducing the manual load. It can also build analytical reports to increase the revenue and manage the resources according to the needs. 

#### Implementation:<br>
We have used open-source MERN stack for the development. MERN stack enabled us to create entire project using javascript language. The front-end was built using React.js and Tailwind CSS. Express and Node.js were used to build the back-end. We are planning to incorporate No-SQL MongoDB as the database to retrieve and add the information.

<ul>
<li> Lab-2: Identified the Functional and non-functional requirements of the project and finalized the project model tobe used in the course.  </li>
<li> Lab-3: Made the use-case diagram and stated the relationships and multiplicities between the actors and the use cases. Documented the use case textual description for each use case. Justified the non-functional requirements.</li>
<li> Lab-4: Fianlized the tool, frameworks and technologies to be used for the project. Effort estimation using Use case size point. </li>
<li> Lab-6: Developed Domain analysis model, sequence diagram, class diagram, identified the design goals, entity obejects, boundary objects and control objects. </li>
</ul>
